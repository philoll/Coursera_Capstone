# Exploring Cuisines in Sydney

## Introduction

Australia is a nation of diverse cultures. With that comes a multitude of cuisines, which presents a challenge for any hungry soul looking to fill their stomach. For a tourist with their eye on food, Sydney and Melbourne are often on the top of their list of Australian cities to visit due to their abundance of restaurants - Sydney because of the diversity of cuisines on offer, and Melbourne because of the unique coffee culture. But is this actually the case? In recent times, both Sydney and Melbourne have seen large numbers of family-run restaurants and cafes pop up, making the comparison a rather difficult one.

This leads to the question: is Sydney still the powerhouse for choice in cuisine, and is Melbourne still a coffee haven? This article aims to differentiate the two cities and to find out what each city truly has on offer.

It is hoped that this article can provide clarity for any budding foodie. It can also provide some insight for Sydney-siders and Melbournians on what is available in their backyard.
